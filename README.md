In this repo, I have included the training codes, generated weights, and Jupyter notebooks for four systems:

<ol>
<li>BBA</li>
<li>Villin</li>
<li>PRB</li>
<li>AT-All DNA</li>
</ol>

The training paradigm with the best results are marked accordingly before the directory name.

The **BBA** and **Villin** systems were trained to completion. As of writing this, **PRB** and **DNA** still have some issues.
